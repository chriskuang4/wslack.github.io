	<p class="lead" markdown="1">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Will</span>. I love helping people.</p>
	<p>Passionate about improving my local, national, and worldwide communities, I believe that today's new communications technologies show unrealized potential in improving public debate, education, and healthcare delivery. I seek to move policies into practice with compassion and care, moving good ideas into wise practice. That work began as an Implementer / Project Manager at Epic in Verona WI and continues in Washington DC.
	<p>I am currently serving a term appointment at <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">18F</a>, a digital design and technology agency within the U.S. government, as Acting Director for Products and Platforms.</p>
	<p>Outside of work, I spend a lot of time singing, reading, and ideating on how technology will impact our lives in the future.</p>
